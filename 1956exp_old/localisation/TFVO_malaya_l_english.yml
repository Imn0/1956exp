This policy build a thick wall between the locals and the immigrants.

But the lack of support for the Far East defense greatly weakened those colonies in Asia."

 #Events
 mal.1.t:0 "The Origin of Ethnic Conflict"
 mal.1.d:0 "The British started to control Malaya since the Pangkor Treaty of 1874. They indirectly rule those sultanates through the residential system, and protect the rights and interests of the aborigines. On the other hand, many chinese and indian people immigrated to Malaya since the 19th century. The British ruler neglected the interest of these immigrants and maintain the pro-Malay policy. \n\nMoreover, the colonial government deliberately separated the immigrants from the locals to avoid assimilation between them. This policy stirs up dissension among the Malays, the Chinese and the Indian. It may cause an ethnic conflict in the future."
 mal.1.a:0 "We only care about commercial profit."
 mal.2.t:0 "Operation Matador"
 mal.2.d:0 "Major-General William Dobbie, Officer Commanding Malaya, looked at Malaya's defences and reported that during the monsoon season, from October to March, landings could be made by an enemy on the east coast and bases could be established in Siam. He predicted that landings could be made at Songkhla and Pattani in Siam, and Kota Bharu in Malaya. He recommended a plan that we should implement a pre-emptive strike into Siam. We will send forces to intercept them just over the border in Siam, long enough for the main force to assemble and attack. \n\nHowever, there were several problems with the plan. Firstly, Siam is a neutral country. Secondly, the lack of troops deployed in Malaya to implement the operation."
 mal.2.a:0 "We will plan another operation."
 mal.3.t:0 "Operation Krohcol"
 mal.3.d:0 "London objected to implement Operation Matador. We have planned the Operation Krohcol as an alternative to Matador. Three ad hoc columns were put together to harass and delay the Japanese advance from their beachheads at Songkhla and Pattani. Krohcol was the most important of the three. It was tasked with the destruction of the feature known as the Ledge. \n\n Destruction of the Ledge would effectively block the road from Pattani thereby ensuring the security of 11th Indian Infantry Division's line of communication and retreat."

 mal.4.a:0 "We will directly rule these states."
 mal.6.t:0 "Protest against the Malayan Union"
 mal.6.d:0 "The Malays generally opposed the creation of the Union. The opposition was due to the methods Sir Harold MacMichael used to acquire the Sultans' approval, the reduction of the Sultans' powers, and granting of citizenship to immigrants. The United Malays National Organisation(UMNO), a Malay political association formed by Onn Jaafar, led the opposition against the Malayan Union. They utilised civil disobedience as a means of protest by refusing to attend the installation ceremonies of the British governors. \n\nThey had also refused to participate in the meetings of the Advisory Councils, hence Malay participation in the government bureaucracy and the political process had totally stopped."

 mal.12.t:0 "Rise of Malay Nationalism"
 mal.12.d:0 "The colonial government decided to grant those immigrants equal rights. They broke the traditional ruling method, and not recognise Malay supremacy. The decision seems to lead to more Malays support for nationalism.

But now they lost confidence in the colonial rule because the pro-Malay policy will not be continued."

But most of the Malays lived in rural areas, and were the grassroots in our country. Although now we controlled the government, the Chinese don't want to cooperate with us. We believe that most of Chinese political organizations were manipulated by the Chinese government. We have not enough power to tame them."
 mal.13.a:0 "Curse them!"

However, at the instigation of the British Resident, Theodore Samuel Adams, Tengku Musa Eddin was dismissed as Raja Muda in 1934 for alleged "misbehaviour". Adams had accused Tengku Musa Eddin as a spendthrift and wastrel with a penchant for gambling.Tengku Alam Shah was instead proclaimed Raja Muda or heir to the throne over the head of his other half-brother. \n\nHowever, many Malays in Selangor believed the real reason for Tengku Musa Eddin's dismissal was his refusal to follow Adam's orders. Now the appointment occurred."
 mal.14.a:0 "They must follow our recommendation."
 MAL_selangor_succession_dispute_tt:0 "\nMost of the Malay people §Yare not satisfied§! with this appointment."
 
 mal.15.t:0 "Far East Defense Strategy"
 mal.15.d:0 "In 1920, the Admiralty issued War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920, a series of instructions in the event of a war with Japan. In it, the defence of Singapore was described as "absolutely essential". The strategy was presented to the Dominions at the 1923 Imperial Conference. The memorandum divided a war with Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the garrison of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet made its way from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms. \n\nHowever, due to lack of support for reinforcing Far East defense, we will not be able to implement the second phase."

 mal.17.t:0 "Battle of Kuala Lumpur"
 mal.17.d:0 "The northern part of Malaya, including Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Penang had fallen into Japanese hands. After the Battle of Slim River, the Japanese troops' next military objective was Kuala Lumpur. We decided to abandon Selangor and Negeri Sembilan to the Japanese, and our forces began a quick retreat to Johor then to Singapore. The city, now abandoned, quickly descended into a state of anarchy and chaos. Looting was widespread. The Japanese troops entered Kuala Lumpur without much resistance, besides small skirmishes. They quickly took control of government and institutional buildings, such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, the railway station and the Pudu Jail."

We were forced to retreat towards Johor Bahru; however, following a further series of bombings by the Japanese, , we retreated to Singapore and blew up the causeway the following day as a final attempt to stop the Japanese advancement in British Malaya. The Japanese then used the Sultan's residence of Bukit Serene Palace located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway. They chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor."
 mal.18.a:0 "We may not be able to resist their invasion..."
 
 mal.19.t:0 "Bicycle Infantry"
 mal.19.d:0 "The Japanese invasion of Malaya was largely dependent on bicycle-riding soldiers. Bicycles allowed quiet and flexible transport of thousands of troops who were then able to surprise and confuse the defenders. It also made few demands on the Japanese war machine, needing neither trucks, nor ships to transport them, nor precious petroleum. Using bicycles, the Japanese troops were able to move faster than the withdrawing Allied Forces, often successfully cutting off our retreat."
 mal.19.a:0 "This is really impressive."
